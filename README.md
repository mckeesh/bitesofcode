The vision for bitesofcode is that it will allow users to upload high-quality, "bite-sized" code samples. 
One hope is that it will allow users to avoid getting tangled up in details at the beginning of a project. 
Another hope is that beginners will get to know what good code looks like, something that I never really saw 
until my first internship.
