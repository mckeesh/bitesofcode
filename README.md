bitesofcode

The vision for bitesofcode is that it will allow users to upload high-quality, "bite-sized" code samples. 
One hope is that it will allow users to avoid getting tangled up in details at the beginning of a project by giving them an example that definitely builds and runs. Another hope is that beginners will get to know what good code looks like, something that I never really saw 
until my first internship.

For example, if someone wants to make a simple OpenCV application, I would want them to think, "OK, I will go see if bitesofcode has any examples similar to what I want in the OpenCV category". They would then use the provided instructions to install dependencies, build the example, and run it. They would know that bitesofcode has code that will usually be hassle-free.
